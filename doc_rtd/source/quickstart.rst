==========
Quickstart
==========

I'll put some simple cases here at some point, I think.

Preparing your data
-------------------

Something about summary file:

* required attributes
* optional but useful attributes
* additional functionalities

Something about where to put your data

Running the pipeline
--------------------
python etc..

Use tmux

Troubleshooting and logs
------------------------

Check both stderr/stdout in your current directory and the stuff in ~/logs.

If you used nohup, look at nohup.out.

Most common problem is messed up white space:
- extra tabs in summary files
- ^M character from switching between OS's

Next most common problem is typos:
- check your file paths
- check the summary file attributes and values
